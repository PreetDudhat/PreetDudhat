# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Preet
** 'Tech Alchemist (Developer/Creator)' **
"I'm an indie programmer building my version of the digital world one step at a time. With each coding project, I start from the ground up - planning, designing, and building from scratch. My passion is using code to solve real-life problems and make a positive impact. Join me on this journey as we create something truly remarkable, one line of code at a time."
